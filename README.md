Awesome video by Rudy Faile explaining how to properly download Raylib and MinGW to start a fresh Windows project  

How to compile and run:  

Step 1: Open Windows terminal in the project directory  
Step 2: Run the command ".\build" to execute the "build.bat" file, it makes an output "run.exe" file  
Step 3: Open the "run.exe" file by running the command ".\run" in the terminal or just by double clicking the file in the Windows File Explorer  

To change the map just alter the "iMapSize" variables, you can choose diferent sizes for each axis, to alter the size of the grid just change the "iGridSize' variable    

Side Note: If you know how to mess with MinGW and wish to make some compilation changes, those can be made by modifiying the "build.bat" file
